### :blue_book: Android Architecture, Pattern Notes
Derived from many blog posts, websites, online discussions and experiences. Even after writing a lot of applications, one may forget reasons of used techniques (why i did this, or what is benefit of this pattern...). Reason for this may be copy pasting some of your own code after writing once.

This repo aims to be note to lookup for below topics. It can also be good reference when trying to explain these topics to colleagues.

## Architectures
### 1. Clean Architecture notes
Not ready yet

## Presentation Patterns (Delivery Mechanisms)
### 1. [MVC notes](https://github.com/jemshit/android_architecture_notes/blob/master/mvc_cheatsheet.md)

This is not Android specific note, but MVC variants in general. So difference between these patterns can be seen.

### 2. [MVP notes](https://github.com/jemshit/android_architecture_notes/blob/master/mvp_cheatsheet.md)
Especially from Android perspective

### 3. MVVM notes
Not ready yet

### 4. [Pattern Differences note](https://github.com/jemshit/android_architecture_notes/blob/master/pattern_differences.md)
